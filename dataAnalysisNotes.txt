Data Science/Pandas module



Data is a collection of facts ( can be like textual or digital data)
Information is what you get after analyzing the data.
################################################

ONE DIMENSIONAL-ARRAYS:
[1,2,3,4,5,2,5,2,5]

[1,
 2,
 3,
 4,
 5,
 6,
 7,
 8,
 9]

Size: 1x9

We call one dimensional lists or arrays: series.
A column or a row of a table is called as series.

################################################

MULTIDIMENSIONAL-ARRAY
Shape of a multi-dimensional array means how many rows and columns there are not like, circles or triangles.
Shape = number of rows * number of columns

Ex.
[[1,2,3],
 [4,5,6],
 [8,9,0]]

Size: 3x3

We call a collection of series or the table as a data frame in pandas module.


iloc and loc

iloc works on the copy of a data frame

.iloc[:,:2]
The first colon tells us that it should take all rows in a data frame.
The second colon represents that I need only 2 columns from a data frame


Marks in percentage is derived from marks obtained and total marks

Iloc: Index based mechanism
Loc: Label based mechanism

NUMPY:

SCALAR VALUES:
Scalar values are the numbers which are associated with something. It is also known as the magnitude or quantity.
Ex: 1 —>
A car is running at a speed of 40 km/hr; In this example 40 is the scalar value or the magnitude associated with the speed. 	
Ex: 2 —>
The height of Mt. Everest is 8,848 meters. Here 8,848 is the scalar value associated with the height

VECTORS:
Vectors are the combination of both scalar values or magnitude and direction.
Ex: 1 —>
A car is moving at a speed of 80 km/hr towards east. Here is 80 is the magnitude or the scalar value and east is the direction and since both of them are combined they are known as vectors.
